# Paper Claims and Experiment Status

This file freezes the paper scope so the project does not drift into a mixed
system log.

## Primary claim

Task-grounded calibrated uncertainty improves controlled candidate ranking and
reranking reliability under same-schema evaluation.

The main paper studies whether uncertainty signals can be made decision-useful
for LLM-based recommendation. The contribution is not a new model backbone and
not a generic recommender system.

## Primary contribution statements

1. Diagnosis: verbalized LLM confidence is informative in recommendation, but
   unreliable under miscalibration, confidence collapse, and domain-dependent
   failure.
2. Method: C-CRP, a task-grounded calibrated candidate relevance posterior with
   boundary uncertainty, calibration gap, and evidence insufficiency.
3. Decision: risk-adjusted candidate ranking/reranking evaluated with utility,
   calibration, coverage, exposure, robustness, and paired statistical tests.

## Not primary claims unless completed

- Generative title recommendation.
- Full-catalog SOTA.
- Universal cross-domain winner.
- LoRA distillation as main novelty.
- Shadow v2-v6 as independent main methods.
- Proxy comparisons against reported numbers from incompatible protocols.

## Status labels

Every paper-facing summary table must include `status_label`.

- `completed_result`: runnable and completed under the stated protocol.
- `runnable_not_complete`: code path exists, but the result is not complete
  enough for a main table.
- `design_only`: method or plan is documented but not fully run under the
  frozen protocol.
- `proxy_only`: useful for related-work positioning or fairness audit, but not
  same-schema evidence.
- `future_extension`: intentionally outside the main paper claim.

Rows with `design_only`, `proxy_only`, or `future_extension` must not enter the
main result table. Rows from fallback internal validation splits are not main
table eligible.

## Milestone claim eligibility

The canonical milestone map lives in `docs/milestones/README.md`.

| milestone | paper role | main-table eligible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 Week1-4 / pony12 | diagnosis and motivation | no |
| M1 Pony framework | method and protocol bridge | yes, if completed under frozen protocol |
| M2 Light series | precursor / negative-control ablation | supplementary unless explicitly completed under main protocol |
| M3 Shadow series | task-grounded signal family | diagnostic unless large-scale protocol and validation gates are complete |
| M4 Baseline system | fairness and reviewer defense | yes for completed classical rows; official external rows only after provenance passes |
| M5 Four-domain validation | robustness evidence | yes when 100neg outputs, audits, and paired tests are complete |
| M6 Complete recommender system | future full-system roadmap | no until official baselines, Shadow, LoRA, and generated-title verification are completed |

The `*_style_*` LLM-rec rows are paper-style supplementary rows, not official
reproductions. Official external-baseline claims require the
`*_official_qwen3_lora_*` family plus provenance and score coverage.

## Main table eligibility

A row can enter the main ranking table only if all are true:

- `status_label == completed_result`
- Same-schema data, prompt, candidate construction, and metric definitions are
  used.
- Calibration method and C-CRP weights are selected on validation or fixed
  before test.
- `calibration_split_metadata.csv` has zero user overlap unless the table is
  explicitly labeled non-main.
- Candidate protocol audit exists for the domain/split.
- Statistical tests provide paired confidence intervals for the supported claim.

## Safe wording

Use "observed best" for results whose confidence interval crosses zero or whose
paired test is not significant after correction. Use "winner" only for results
that pass the configured statistical rule.
